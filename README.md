# Elastic Habits
Habit tracking app for people who value consistency over perfection.

## Core Philosophy

Habit setting ambition can often be larger than current ability. Most habit tracking platform present a binary option: either the habit gets done, or it doesn't. This binary leads to many users failing to sustainably achieve ambitious new habit resolutions. Repeatedly failing to achieve a habit target leads to discouragement, causing users to drop a new habit all-together. 

Elastic Habits is a platform that allows user to track habits with a flexibility that is better-suited to the reality of variable motivation and circumstances.

Within the app, users can define the minimum level of effort required to count the habit as completed, as well as defining their target level of effort to aim for. They can also define which life events allow them to resort to a lower threshold to have a clear mitigation plan for known barriers to accomplishing a habit.

For example, a user may want to incorporate a running habit. Their habit set up could look something like this:

* Target: Run 3 miles a day
* Threshold 1: If I have to work late, run 1.5 miles
* Threshold 2: If I have to work late and I am sore, run 0.5 miles

As long as one of the thresholds is met, the habit is counted as completed. Through this method, users create a chain of completed habits regardless of motivation or unavoidable circumstances that positively enforces the internal belief that the habit is achievable.
